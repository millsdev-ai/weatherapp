Weather App

The Weather App is a simple desktop application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to enter the name of a city and retrieve the current weather information for that city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Features

    Enter the name of a city in the text field.
    Click the "Get Weather" button or press Enter to fetch the weather information.
    The application displays the current weather condition and temperature in Celsius.
    Additional weather data such as maximum and minimum temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset times are also shown.

Dependencies

The Weather App requires the following dependencies:

    Python 3.x
    Tkinter
    Requests

How to Run

    Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
    Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

pip install requests

Save the code in a Python file (e.g., weather_app.py).
Run the Python file using the following command:

    python weather_app.py

    The Weather App window will open.
    Enter the name of a city in the text field.
    Click the "Get Weather" button or press Enter to fetch the weather information.
    The weather condition and additional data will be displayed on the screen.

Note

    You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data. Replace 06c921750b9a82d8f5d1294e1586276f in the API URL (api.openweathermap.org) with your own API key.

That's it! You now have a simple Weather App that can fetch weather information for any city. Feel free to modify the code to add more functionality or customize the user interface according to your needs.
